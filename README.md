# weather-forecast-prototype
Simple prototype for openweathermap.org

Objectives
* Create a simple App with a screen that displays the current weather forecast for Dublin.
* Produce clean and well formatted/documented code.
* Send a HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather forecast in Dublin, and parse the response.
* Persist the response so that it can be retrieved again without having to make a further network request and so the app can be used without a network connection.
